Bertie's playing it cool, but you guys coming over for dinner tonight is a really big deal to her, so Be there by 6, and no bailing.
Ooh, bailing on dinner.
Nick, I need you.
Wingman sitch.
Jewish girl, sensible nose.
High-level target.
I can't be your wingman.
We got to go this Bertie dinner.
Don't make it seem like a chore, okay? She is making ten or eleven soups.
And all of them are cream-based.
Cool.
Hey, Mom.
Hi, baby, I'm sorry to interrupt.
I know the morning is the most sensual time of day.
But, um, I need you.
It's your sister.
Abby? What is it? She was arrested at a hotel in San Diego.
How's everything with your sister? I mean, she was caught stealing, they called the cops, it's a mess.
Imagine me next door with a, with a nice Jewish girl.
Hey, Jess has a sister? - Yeah, I've never met her.
I need you to go to the jail, pick her up and put her on a plane home.
Oh, that's fabulous.
And by the way, um I don't know what kind of jail this is.
So be prepared for anything.
I mean, wear a shirt you don't love-love.
Okay.
Love you.
Hi Nick Okay, here, these are all the ladles that I could find.
Ooh, this one is deep.
Well, what's up with your sister? Well, she's coming to town.
Great! - Ooh, yikes, that's The best news ever? I know! It's so, so, so, so, so, so, so good.
Well, I can't wait to meet the mysterious Abby Day.
Not mysterious.
Jet setter.
You know, I always imagined her with a French-speaking black husband, like a Jerome St.
Pierre.
So, I'll probably meet her at the airport for a little layover hang.
Why are you ignoring me, Nick? - 'Cause I'm paying - Nick! - attention to my girlfriend.
There, a reaction! Thank goodness! Now I know I'm not a ghost.
All right, I got to go.
Oh, you're going? I'll, uh, I-I got to go.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, Jess, Jess! What if I came with? Yeah, you know, I don't think - you two would really get along.
Why not? Look, I just haven't seen her in a really long time, and Jess, I'd like to meet your sister.
Why don't we do this? Um Why don't I go pick her up? And then come meet us for a quick dinner before she leaves? That would be awesome.
That's all I was looking for.
Yeah.
Okay.
Winston, we can't make your dinner! - Bye, Winston.
I'm not gonna be with you.
Wait! No, no, no, no! Wait Hey, hey.
Are you really letting Nick meet Abby? Hell no.
I'm going to pick her up from jail.
Like, straight-up jail.
I told Nick he could meet her on her "layover" but, whoops, her flight got changed.
No time.
Sorry.
Bye, Nick! I'll see you later! - I'm out of shampoo! Gonna use bar soap! But your sister won't know the difference! Okay! Can't wait for you to meet her! He's never going to meet her.
Hey, dude.
I can't go to this dinner.
It's a double date now.
Things are already weird enough between me and Cece.
Because you went on a date two months ago and she never texted you? Yeah.
Be a man, Coach! - All right.
Be there by 6:00 and bring a bottle of wine.
And don't be cheap, either.
Bertie is a Somalian.
Okay.
Oh, tidings, Abigail.
I'm Jess's beau.
My name is Nicholas.
It's a pleasure to - Oh, good God.
Is that a common barber's comb? - Look, Schmidt, I just want to make a good impression on Jess's sister.
Yeah, well, I want Julia Child not to be dead, but here we find ourselves.
What did you come here to talk to me about? As I was saying earlier, I have a very difficult flirting situation here.
I mean, it's a double black diamond: trees, moguls.
And, as we both know, you're the best wingman who's ever wung.
Thank you, Schmidt! I'm almost glad I got in the accident so we can have more days like this together, with you helping me through this.
Hocod a guy so rich be so generous with his time? Whoa Excuse me.
Are you the writer of So You've Mastered the Female Orgasm, Now What? - Incredible.
Can I have your autograph? - Of course.
Come on, man.
It's a quick party.
I'll have you back by your little dinner.
Okay, I'll do it, but as soon as Jess says I've got to go, I'm out.
Thank you very much.
For your mitigated support and tiny portion of your life.
Sure.
Okay.
Hey, Abby.
Oh, look who came to pick up her big, bad sister.
So, you good to go? Or you gotta sign yearbooks or something? Bridget stole your gum.
What? You took my Fruity Fruit? I ain't got your Fruity Fruit, bitch! - Oh, my God.
Oh - Gum? I want my Fruity Fruit! I ain't got your Fruity Fruit, bitch! What about the new guy? I want to meet him.
We don't really have time to meet him 'cause I have to take you to the airport 'cause Mom's already bought you a ticket.
I know all of her credit card information, - No.
and I can just change it.
Wait, what are you doing? Wait, no.
Sweet.
Why don't you just for once in your life do something that you're not supposed to do? I didn't put the cap back on the honey bear the other day.
Drive.
Drive.
Drive.
Oh, my God.
No! No! - No! No! I will not drive unsafely! - Try-try it! I have a perfect record.
Get your hands away from me.
Why don't you want me to meet him? - About.
Are you embarrassed of me? - I do.
No.
Great.
'Cause I just got on a later flight.
That's great.
So excited.
I know.
Did you just start driving really slow? No, I actually think I'm speeding.
I hope there's no coppers around.
Drive faster.
Sorry, sir! Thank you for your service! - What is this place? - It's a bar mitzvah.
I am not watching a kid get circumcised.
The target is Rachael.
She's a Hebrew school teacher.
Crashing some random kid's bar mitzvah's the best way to get her? Get her on the dance floor, a little bit softer now, a little bit louder now, sweep her off her feet, we'll get married, we'll have a son named Elon.
At his bar mitzvah, I tell the story of how I met his mom at this bar mitzvah.
Not a dry eye in the house.
Jewiontinuity, et cetera, et cetera.
Do you realize how long you were just talking? There she is.
Whew! - A beautiful piece of hamentaschen.
What the hell is hamentaschen? Problem is her dad is my rabbi.
He hates me.
So I just need to charm Rachael before he gets to her and tells her horrible-slash-true things - about me.
Absolutely.
Oh! Hello! - What a day.
Oh a special day.
Oh, take my hand.
Take your hand.
A special day.
You just wanted to take my hand so you could say that again, didn't you? Mmm, I did.
I don't think we've had the pleasure of meeting.
May I take your hand, too? You can take anything you want, Shirley.
So, yeah, just the just the two of us with Bertie and Winston tonight? Yeah, just, uh just-just you and me.
Uh, and Bertie.
And Winston.
Just eating night lunch.

Nothing.
No.
Mmm, you want to have s*x with her, you are not so sure.
If she doesn't want to put out, I will.
Abby Day - There you go.
Abby Day, she always says The most inappropriate stuff.

Okay, I'm scared of you.
Let's go in my room Don't hurt me.
Please don't hurt me.

Ugh.
What a spread, huh? - Terrible.
I agree.
Thank God I have pizza in my car.
Yeah, that's very funny.
What's the matter with you? That wasn't a joke.
Who has pizza in their car? Listen, when I make a joke, you'll know it.
I'm a joke machine.
What are the chances? I love jokes! Oh, good, okay.
Uh Oh, did you hear the one about the waiter? - No.
Walks up to a table full of Jewish women and says, "Ladies, is anything all right?" Hi.
Rack-hael! Baruch ata Ado, nice dress.
Oh, thank you! - Uh, Shabbat sha-hello.
Yeah.
It wasn't as good as mine, but it was cute.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Thanks.
How's Hebrew school? - It's fine.
It's the only place that would hire me after I got out of rehab.
Two Jews walk into a bar.
They buy it.
'Cause they're rich people.

What's a shanda? A shanda! What a shanda! All you care about is Jess.
Remember when we used to be best friends? Uh, that was neat.
What a neat time in my life that was.
Hey, Schmidt! My girlfriend's embarrassed of me.
Can we go on that for a little bit? Or does the wingman never get to, you know, flap his wings? The bird never gets to be the main bird.
This.
Ugh! So, I just talked to Nick, and this is a real shame in the pants, but he's not coming home tonight.
What? Why? - He had to hang out with his work friends.
He can't come and see me? - Guess it's just us till the airport.
Mmm.
You see what you're doing, right? Oh, my God.
Mom.
No! I'm turning into Mom.
How did this happen? - "Just a little bit.

" Oh, my God.
Wait.
Big news.
Mom got one of those very, very small denim backpacks.
What? - She did, and she calls it her blue guy.
She's, like, "Oh, I got to grab my blue guy.
" Can't believe you're making fun of Mom.
You're her perfect little baby.

Quick question.
Is pee-pee a write-off? Hey.
Not sure my body's built for these chairs.
It's a regular chair, man.
Yeah.
Hey, bub.
How you doing? Well, I want to apologize.
Sorry I got distracted.
It's okay.
I'm sorry your girlfriend hates you.
Ah, she doesn't hate me.
She's just ashamed of me or something.
Well, you know what? If she's really ashamed of you, then then she's the stupidest bitch in the whole wide world.
Easy.
Okay, slow down.
I apologize if I went overboard.
Water under the bridge.
I've never been ashamed.
Wish I could have helped you get that girl, man.
Feel like I blew it.
Well, she was kind of nutty.
What happened to us, man? We used to be the best in the biz.
We still are.
I'm the best wingman that's ever wung.
Make a plan? - Absolutely.
You're my brother.
Thank you.
Charge that to room 304.
Ah! You! Charge that to nothing.
She's checking out.
Adding this hotel to your rap sheets? You found me.
Oh, yeah.
Don't you want to know why I left? You saw my text, and I'm I'm honestly sorry, but you do ruin everything! Whoa.
Thought I was gonna turn the tables with that one.
Get your ass in the car.
I'm taking you to the airport.
Thought we could share some calamari.
Now! - Kobe beef sliders? - Now! - Lobster quesadilla? Right now.
This is a great Mmm.
You know, Bertie had a dream she killed me.
So, uh, Coach, what's new? Nothing.
Isn't that right, Cece? Hmm? What's that supposed to mean? Oh, you'll figure it out.
If not, just text me.
Or don't.
You're good at that.
Oh, my God.
Okay.
We made out once, pointlessly, for two hours.
That's it.
Get over it.
Let it go.
Pointless was it? - Yeah.
I mean, who does that?! Super-hot make out, and then, you ice me out for two months.
What are you talking about?! Ice out what? You text me, "Happy Monday.
" What do I do with that? Oh, I don't know.
Maybe have a happy Monday.
Going out with you was the hottest and dumbest mistake I ever made! It was the hottest, dumbest, sexiest mistake I ever made.
It was so dumb of me to pick you up and press you up against that wall.
So dumb how cool those bricks made my skin feel.
You guys should try the fisherman's bisque.
Has just the right amount of tang.
That tang? - Mm.
That's tang.

Now what do we do? Maybe just, like, lower your center of gravity, and then this is gonna work.
Just lower it down, I'm gonna clench my thighs.
I'm gonna fall.
I'm gonna fall - I'm clenching my thighs as hard as I can.
Okay, okay.
What? Oh.
Geez.
Oh! - Geez.
That was awful.
That was the worst.
Oh, my gosh.
Wow, what is happening? - Oh, Lord.
Maybe you were right not to text me back, 'cause that was embarrassing.
I'm sorry.
No, that's cool.
Can we just be friends now? You know? Yeah.
I mean, why not? Friends? Friends.
Friends.
Come here, you.
Oh, oh! - Aah! Sorry.
I'm sorry.

Literally just bit my tooth.
I'm sorry, when I get excited my teeth come out.
Who does that? - Sorry.
I think I broke my tooth.
Let me see? Oh.
Okay.
Go straight to the gate.
Look I get why you're mad at me.
Okay? But if it's any consolation, I'm a woman in my 30s about to get on a plane to go live with my mother.
It's only a matter of time before I have a tiny denim backpack, too.
I said I would never go back to Portland.
So I guess I'm a complete failure.
I'm the baby.
Is this the craziest thing that's going on in the airport? Really? Okay, recap, you hit the dance floor, and Do what I do best, be an embarrassment.
Well, it's a gift, Nick.
I need you to ruin this bar mitzvah.
What do you say, just get out there and do some weird dancing? - It's got to be bigger than that, man.
Bigger than that? Then I come out there and I knock you out.
It's all right.
Again, it'll be a stage punch.
Don't worry.
I've done several productions of West Side Story.
I know.
You told me.
As a Puerto Rican Shark.
Da, da.
That's cool.
It was awesome.
You never came and saw it, but - Well, I was very busy at that time.
Whatever, never mind.
The rabbi will then come out, he'll thank me, - the hero - Gotcha.
He'll offer me his daughter's hand, then, five years from now, Rachael is pregnant with Elon's little sister and we're having a beautiful family New Year's then in our vacation condo - in the Florida Keys.
You're doing it again, you're talking in speeches.
You've been monologuing, lately, Schmidt.
Do you s Do you, do you hear yourself? - I-I'm unaware of it.
You Okay.
I'm not gonna get mad at you, 'cause I respect you and you're one of - I'm unaware of it.
But, like, it's weird.
I apologize.
I'll stop doing it.
