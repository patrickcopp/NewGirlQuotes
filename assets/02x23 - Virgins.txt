WINSTON Oh, my goodness.
Oh, hey, guys, you have any hair you want removed? Hey.
I must respectfully decline such a horribly depressing invitation.
Going on a date with Elizabeth tonight. I haven't had s*x with her since I was fat and accessing my pen1s was like getting the remote control out of the couch.
Now I know things, and I own things.
Like this.
What is that?
Oh, my God, that poor girl.
This is the Archduke.
The crowning achievement of the German Institute of Female Pleasure.
Dude, this thing takes single A batteries?
I thought I threw that thing out the window.
That only made it stronger. 
WINSTON Oh, that reminds me Daisy called, and we're going out tonight.
(chuckles)
Yeah, she sounded pretty excited.
I do believe her exact words were, "This is your last chance."
So, I'm very confident.
Yeah.
Very confident.
(cell phone rings)
Schmidt, can you help me with my phone? I have...
Oh, you need help?
Where's your women's lib now?
From Teddy
"In town tonight. Would love to see you. p.m. drinks?"
CECE Oh, my God, Teddy.
JESS Oh, my God.
Hey, who's Teddy?
Whoa, hey, man.
What are you doing...?
JESS Nick? Weird and gross.
Sometimes I just sit in the stall and listen to you guys.
Who's Teddy?
OTHERS Makes sense.
What do you think he wants? You think I should meet him for a drink?
Am I the only one kind of dying to know who this Teddy character is?
I think I speak for all of us...
Nick, you and Jess didn't work out, okay?
No...

Yeah, "ww" It's not
about that, just...
Chill out.
Yeah, no. Thanks.
JESS
Fine. Look. Um... (sighs)
I already regret this. Teddy...
Teddy took my flower.
Wow, yeah, he did.
What flower? What?!
Yeah, he stole a flower from you?
(chuckles)
And you want to have drinks with him?
Oh, from your wonderful secret garden.
CECE Ugh.
Oh, my God. You guys do have to hear this story, though.
'Cause it is the worst. It's the worst!
No, no.

So, you mean to tell me you didn't lose your virginity at prom?
Technically, no.
Technically?
Damn it, Jess.
Technically, why did we listen to that whole story, then?
Technically, this guy's the worst. (chuckles)
There was no s*x.
Playing guitar for girls.
Girls don't like that.
That's a fact.

It's okay, man.

I was in the prologue.

Really?
Who was it with?
Study Hall Steve or Cool Car Johnny?

Oh, yeah.
Not exactly.
Not them.
So what? I'm a virgin.
I don't want to plan it out.

Jess, you have no chance of winning.
SCHMIDT It was my junior year of college. I was about pounds heavier.
Freshman plus sophomore
plus junior .
I got some lubricant.
It's to use on a woman.
Uh...
to increase her pleasure.
Hey... is it chill if I have the room later?
Elizabeth and I have been talking, and... we plan on merging tonight.
Yeah, Schmidt!
pen1s, v*g1n*.

The room's all yours, cowboy.
Yeah, I got some, uh, mushrooms, and I'm going to a Dave Matthews concert later.
I'm a Daver.
(Jess groans)
CECE That sucks!
WINSTON White people.
Is this the first time you'll be making... full love?
No way, Jose.
Look, Nick... back in high school, they used to call me... the s*x... the s*x Hammer.
That's a great nickname.
But, you know, now that we're sitting here talking, would you mind having a discussion, uh, openly about the subject of intercourse?
Shoot.
Cool.
Hey, does it hurt for the guys?
Not one bit.
If I pee while it's happening, will she die?
How many minutes before s*x is it... is it okay to eat?
I don't think it's an exact science.
I think it depends on your frame.
So, I should eat right before.
In terms of lubricant, do I put a small amount everywhere or do I use a large amount
in a small... in a smaller area?
(groans)
You're harshing my vibe,
Schmidt.
You're the coolest, Nick.
You know, so I'd already taken the mushrooms.
Obviously.
And I was ready to go to the concert, when I realized that the troll at the end of my bed was pretty upset about it.
I don't want any trouble. I think you're a remarkable creature.
(quietly)
No.
Oh... I feel hot in my pants.

(laughter)
Look, when we were dating, I was very limited as to what we could do sexually.
It wasn't until the Iraqi war that I realized a guy could even be on top.
But that's all different now.
Now I have the Archduke.
Schmidt, have you ever considered not using lube and some giant s*x toy, and just being with her?
Plain Janeing it?
Yeah, okay.
Well, I know for a fact that I can't win this thing,
because my story was... beautiful.
BOTH Aw.
NICK No, your story was not beautiful.
Nick's dad took us on a business trip to New York, right?
And he said that we could do whatever we wanted.
(chuckles)
And we did.

Oh, man.
They're all on the Titanic.
How does this movie end?

NICK Don't. Don't.
Hey.
I didn't bring you two dummies all the way to New York so you can park your cans on the couch, watch TV and flick each other's Bics.
Hey, Dad, last night, somebody broke in and ordered a pornographic movie, so there's a mistake on the bill.

Yeah, okay, you can tell that to the Marines.

Absolutely.
Thank you, guys, for coming.

WINSTON So Mysteria and I made love that night.
For ten beautiful seconds.
So, what do you do for a living?
(snickers)
And it was good.
Nick, I can't believe you lost your virginity to Octopussy.
I couldn't go through with it.
It's 'cause the boy had no game.
He couldn't close.
Okay, you don't need game.
They were prostitutes.
My dad told me.
PopPop told you? When?
Nicky, you here?
Yeah, I'm here, Dad.
What are you doing?
If I'm being totally honest, I've had some alcoholic beverages tonight.
Well, to be totally honest with you, so have I.
How do you think I got through Annie?
Geez, that was rough.
What happened here?
I'm sorry, Dad.
I couldn't make love to Ms. Octopussy tonight.
It's too dangerous, and I was afraid the FBI was gonna track me down or a paper trail.
You think too much.
You think too much about everything.
When I was your age, my dad got a girl for me, too.
I mean, this is almost a Miller family tradition.
You should have seen her boobs.
They were great.
Real pointy, just like I like 'em.
Gross.
Listen, Nicky, you don't have to do anything that you don't want to do.
I just want to make sure that you don't miss out on the things in life that are happening when you're not thinking.
Because, believe you me,
those... are the best things in life.
I think I really like drinking.
Well, that's great.
That's wonderful. That's good.
That's a great start.
It's really fun.
It makes me feel good.
Good.
(chuckles)
Uh...
Don't tell Winston about the girls.
You know,
that they're... pros.
Yeah, I won't. I don't want to break his heart, you know?
Okay.
I mean, you can tell him, but just...
wait, you know?
Maybe after I'm gone.
I'll tell him when you're dead.
So it's time you should know.
Mysteria...
On the bright side, looks like you won the contest.
Actually...
Jess, look at him.
Let him have this.
Yeah, I'm sorry, Winston.
I just can't let you win this.
My story...
involves...
murder.
(laughs)
Was Mysteria even her real name?
No.
So I'd just moved to L.A. to be with Cece, and we went out to some bar.
Do you remember where that was?
No.
How did I get this far without having s*x?
In three years,
I'm gonna be .
I can't rent my first car as a virgin.
They'll know.
Okay. What about those guys over there?

Pour beer at the same time.

Yeah!
I mean, kill me.
Oh, my God.
It was the guy from prom night.
It was fate.
Want to get out of here?

Like, to do it?

Yeah. I'd be down with that.
Yes.
Um, but I'm kind of living
out of my car right now.
Damn it.
Yeah.
And I'm sleeping on my friend's couch.
Do you like DVDs?
Do you sell cookies?
Not a cookie bar.
I have an idea.

Hey, uh, I'm kind of on a lot of antidepressants right now, so this may kind of take a while.
The only antidepressants you need are in my pants.
Uh, it's really a medical issue.
I'm so sorry.
That was really uncool.
And... take as much time as you need.
So, two hours later...
still nothing.

Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
