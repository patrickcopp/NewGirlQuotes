Schmidt? Schmidt.
Nah, it's me.
Easier to clean myself off this way.
Aly told me she loved me last night.
Then she yakked on my pants, and then I yakked on my pants.
I picked the wrong day to start cuffing my pants.
[laughing]
Yeah, she ain't going to make it to the wedding.
Have you seen Schmidt? This is very important.
What?
The best man has lost the groom, or something?
In what world would that happen in?
In what world?
In what world would that happen in?
It's one thing for Sam to dump me on your wedding day, but then to be like, You have feelings for Nick.
Yeah, nice diagnosis, Dr. Dick.
Is he that off-base?
Yes.
Now, we're not devoting any more of your wedding day to this subject.
[over walkie-talkie] Nick for Jess. Incoming knocking.
Jess, have you seen... uh, uh, cherries?
I'm so confused by your question, that I'm just going to answer it, uh, directly.
Yes, I've seen them.
Hmm... but have you seen the cherry that I'm talking about?
What do you mean?
I... the... I was with it, and then the cherry's gone.
[phone rings]
This is cherries. This is cherries.
Yes!
Yeah, I'm counting down the minutes till I can get in that guy's pants.
[laughs softly]
Ah. Thank God, Schmidt. Where are you?
I'm flying to Portland to try to get Cece's mom to come to the wedding.
Hold on, one second, okay?
No!
It was my job.
You still there?
♪
I-I don't know if you remember this, but w-we have plans today.
It'll be fine, okay?
I have return tickets for 1:00, 2:00 and 3:00 p.m. on this ultra low cost, no-frills, disgusting airline.
Tray tables, $12.
Cece is crushed that her mom is not coming, and I can't take a vow that all I care about is her happiness and not try to do something about it.
I know you're a terrible liar, but I need you to lie to Cece.
You can handle this, Nick.
Schmidt's on a plane?!
You said you weren't going to yell.
You said, and I quote, It's no biggie.
Hey, um, I think I did something wrong with my bangs.
I'll be right there.
So will Schmidt.
Oh, my God.
What?
Uh, no, he won't.
It's bad luck for the bride to see the groom on the wedding day, Nick.
Uh, that's just dumb superstition.
He'll be right in.
Cece. Two minutes.
Okay, I'm timing you. [Door closes]
I need you to pull it together, and just say something simple.
Schmidt's asleep.
Schmidt is asleep.
That's...
Schmidt's asl... What-what rhythm are we doing?
The normal human rhythm.
Okay. Schmidt is asleep.
Schmidt is asleep.
Nick.
Did I say it, or no?
You said it, But it wasn't right.
But it sounded very weird.
But it wasn't right.
Just say it like all one. In all one.
Yeah, Schmidt is asleep.
You could just say, Schmidt's asleep.
Got it.
Schmidt's asleep. Got it.
No, you're putting weird emphasis on weird syllables.
You do it.
Schmidt's asleep.
Hey, Cece, Schmidt's sleeping, slip.
I'm so nervous, I'm going to screw this up.
You're always so ready to believe the worst in yourself, and right now, I need you to believe the best, okay?
I just need you to tell one lie.
Okay.
I believe in you.
Here comes Schmidt!
What?
Coach: Yo, Winnie.
Hey.
How you going to prank the wedding, bro?
You always prank weddings, that's what you do.
You've never gone along with one of my pranks before.
This is exciting.
[screaming]
[guests exclaiming]
Coach, I've lived many lives.
The Winston that you used to know is gone.
A few hours ago, Aly told me she loves me, and that made me a serious man, in a serious relationship.
The Winston Bishop that you see here today is about one thing and one thing only: and that is organizational excellence.
You forgot to make an aisle.
Aw, shoot. This is a full redo.
Incoming knocking. Incoming kn...
Oh, hello, Cece.
Schmidt is asleep.
Oh, my God. I'm so proud of you.
I know, I'm an incredible liar.
Yeah, pace yourself, 'cause that was one lie.
We're going to need about 40 more.
Or one big one.
Okay, we tell Cece we're giving her a bridal vitamin, but secretly we give her a sleeping pill that we take from Dr. Sam.
[sighs]
Dr. Sam dumped me. Last night.
He was in love with his best friend, so.
Predictable. [Laughs nervously]
He's out of his mind.
Thanks.
You okay?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Ah, so we're both going solo to the wedding.
Yeah.
We're both going drag.
I think it's stag.
Hmm?
Never mind.
Let's go together. For old times' sake.
Let's go together. Have some fun.
You're going to need someone to dance with.
You know I'm a good dancer.
Okay, but I'm not dancing to Single Ladies.
All right.
We won't dance to Single Ladies.
Okay.
I might dance to Single Ladies.
Hey, guys.

You asked me to be your date to the wedding, and I had to be in town anyway, so here I am. [Phone rings]
Nick: Excuse me one second, Reagan.
It's cherries on the phone.
Wedding stuff. Kitchen's still the kitchen, bathroom's still the bathroom, and Winston's married.
Oh, I know. He texts me every day.
Schmidt, are you calling me from the sky?
This Chinatown bus doesn't have a sky-phone, or working landing gear, apparently.
They said we're going to be stuck on the tarmac for hours.
You're screaming in my ear. That's motherhood, lady.
Get used to it.
Schmidt, you are getting off that plane [walkie-talkie clicks] in time for your wedding.
Cece: Schmidt's on an airplane?
Cece?
Oh, my God. Are you sitting on your walkie?
Oh, no.

Cece.
Schmidt's asleep?

This is by far the most romantic thing that anyone has ever done for me.
I love you so much.
This is why I'm marrying you, because you do stuff like this.
This is the happiest day of my life.
It's also so dumb. So dumb. Like, so dumb.
Just the dumbest.
I want to take all your clothes off and kiss every single part of your body.
I want to do stuff that makes us feel ashamed about what we've done, but we won't have to...

Hey, Schmidt.
I'm also here.
Schmidt: Cece.
Listen to me.
I'm not going to miss this wedding.
I'm going to get off this plane no matter what.
You just need to buy me an hour.
We got this.
There's been a minor delay.

So do you know the bride or the groom?
The bride destroyed my heart.
I destroyed the groom's Jew pen1s.
Mm. I hope you guys are giving a toast.

Damn it!
I'm getting married today!
Somebody get me off of this plane!
People are getting hammered, over.

I did.

Take it home.
Take it to the mat.
I don't know what that means.

Oh, a relationship?
No.

No, no.

I'm, of course, talking about, uh, rasslin'.
Yeah, I think that's a W, W-R.

Jess...
I have some Honduran matrimony beads for my son.
Where's Schmidt?

Jess [whispering]: Winston.
Winston.
I cannot believe I'm asking this... but I need you to prank this wedding.
Please.
Please, we need to distract people.
He's a serious man now.
He doesn't prank anymore.
Just look at his eyes.
All the mischief's gone.
If this were another time, another day, hell, even six hours ago...
Listen to me, you bird-shirted, puzzle baby.
You get out there and you do something totally idiotic right now!

Funston, we have a pranklem.

I'm not good at these.
It's a weird one.
Okay... update.
The vibe's getting ugly.
People are getting dangerously drunk.
I found a loose EpiPen on the floor, which can't be good.
I think we're gonna have to start telling people that Schmidt's... on a plane.
Or not. Don't freak out.
Mom?
Schmidt's on a plane?
Mom, what are you doing here?
If you've come to object to this wedding, you are too late, and in another sense, because it's delayed, you're... too early.
That's not at all why I'm here.
Schmidt: Mama P. Schmidt with the latest, Why I Love Cece. Today's episode: Honesty with a Capital Ouch. He called you?
Every Monday for the past year.
[beeps] Your daughter is the best thing...
[beeps] I just lost a fight in the desert, but...
[beeps] And I want her to be the last thing I see when she pulls the plug.
[beeps] But it's not an A-plus unless we both finish. [Beeps]
She's so beautiful.
The odds are really stacked against our children.
They're not all winners.
[beeps] I just know that if you miss your daughter's wedding, you're going to regret it for the rest of your life.
I am delighted for you to marry this man.

Just get here when you can, okay?
We'll wait until you do.
You know what? Have the party without me.

No. Okay, no.

And now who's in control? I could point to you and call you out, but I won't.
When I first met this guy, Schmidt, I thought, I'm not gonna be friends with him.
I don't like his personality.
Magic's fake.

Believe what you want, but I want you guys to think about something, and now this is off the jack.
In a couple generations, we're all gonna be dead, and no one's gonna remember any of us.
I mean, think about it. Do you remember your great-great grandparents or... or their parents, or what they did day to day?
The point is, it doesn't matter.
Everyone you know will be dead.
That's right.
Congratulations, man. I love you.
Best friends.
That's my time, everybody. Thank you.

Nah, I'm just feeling bad about Reagan.

On a train? Where's she going, Hogwarts?
No, San Diego.

Never mind.
But, I mean, it's okay. I just, I feel like I, you know...

Talk me up a little bit?
Woman to woman?
