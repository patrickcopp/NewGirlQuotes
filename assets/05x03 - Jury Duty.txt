Please, I need you.
No, Nick.
It's a right and a privilege.
In South Africa, they don't even have juries.
They have a-a judge and two assessors.
God, I would have bullied you as a kid.
Jury duty is supposed to be a sacrifice.
Would I like to be at work right now, participating in the Spirit Week assembly?
Yeah, I would.
I've turned in some memorable performances in the past.
But it's just one day... you'll be fine without me.
Now that Cece and Schmidt are engaged, she's here all the time, and her stuff is everywhere.
Okay, yes, she's a hot slob.
Ever since she got boobs, people stopped making her do stuff.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, that is not an excuse.
When I first grew boobs, people started handing me stuff, and I got messy, but then you got to grow up.
Not the same thing.
They're just boobs.
I promise you, tonight when I get back from jury duty, I will explain it to her in a way that she'll listen to, unlike your way, where she'll rip your dingle off and sew it back on your head like a unicorn horn.
She doesn't even live here.
She never signed our loft agreement.
She doesn't even know all the rules.
(laughing): Hi. Look at you.
You look so cute.
(chuckling): Thank you.
Cece: Love this top.
Jess, Nick needs to stop telling that wet pants story, okay?
I know.
I've heard it four times this week.
So I take a hot glass out of the dishwasher, I pour cold water into it, then the customer picks up the glass, and the bottom falls off.
Oh, that's crazy.
For real?
Nick: He looks down, and he goes, like, (Italian accent): "Oh, my pants are wet."
(laughing)
I know, he-he needs to shape that story.
I don't know how you live with him.
He is the most obnoxious...
Winston: Knock it off. (indistinct arguing)
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Stop. Stop it. Knock it off.
Jess, are you cool with me hanging this groundbreaking poster of dogs playing poker on the wall?
Jess, please tell him that he cannot hang this horrible painting.
I really have to go.
I think it's hilarious... they're playing poker.
Rather see a painting of Arnold Schwarzenegger, mid-coitus.
(grunts)
Just straight up doing it.
Let's talk about the painting tonight.
Uh, do nothing till I get home.
Do nothing till I get home.
Do nothing till I get home.
Schmidt: Bye-bye.
Bye.
Okay. - Yeah.
Nick: That's my guy.
Is it me, or is Cece really...
Both: Messy.
Yes.
(scoffs) Dude.
I love it when we say things at...
Same time. the same time.
Just... just... we're right there s...
R-Right there s...
Wait.
When we say things at the... same... time.
Same... time.
Okay, now you're getting in your head again.
Just relax.
Remember the thing about Cece being really...
Both: Messy.
And we say things at the same...
The same...
See, you're getting in your head because you're going quieter.
Just go with your gut.
(groans)
Isn't Cece really... messy?
This is fun. Messy.
-'Cause we say things at the same... time.
Time.
I'm done with you.
I had it.

Trying to get out of jury duty?
Excuse me?
The way you're dressed, like you're in a school play about old people.
You want the judge to think you're crazy.
These are my real clothes, and I would never try to get out of jury duty.
It's not just a right; it's also a privilege.
And who are you to talk about clothes?
You're just wearing a blue suit.
Oh, call Milan.
Notice I'm not calling Milan.
Wow.
I'm sorry.
I actually agree with you.
Can we start over?
Can I buy your coffee for you?
Herbal tea, and make it a big one.
You got it.
(cell phone rings)
Oh, excuse me.
Yeah.
Oh, hey, Nick.
I just met the other only person in America who cares about jury duty, and he's a gosh-damn dreamboat.
Jess, we have an emergency.
Cece's washing her clothes, and I can't even get down the hall.
She's built a laundry dam.
Well, can't you just step over it?
No time.
You know I need to go straight from the bathroom to the kitchen. It's a blood sugar thing.
Winston: Hey, Jess, it's your roommate Winston Bishop.
Isn't it amazing how a frame can elevate already great art?
Winston, don't hang that picture till I get home.
And I would talk to Schmidt about it, but it's like he can't even see the mess.
It's like he's love-blind or something.
Oh, man, I've never been this happy in my entire life.
I got to tell you, you guys, Cece and I just had shower s*x.
Don't.
Did he just kiss you?
Why does he act like the Pope when he's happy?
I guess I'll just talk to Cece myself, and I'll tell her she's a disgusting beast, and she'll have to listen to me 'cause I'm the man of the house.
What?! No, no, no!
Do not talk to Cece.
Also... everything you just said was offensive. Everything.
Do not talk to Cece.
Ignore every natural instinct you have.
What's up, dude?
Hey, you mind if I steal Jess for a second?
Be careful. The screen's cracked.
You might cut your face off.
Yeah.
Nick: Hey, Jess, I'm gonna give you to... to Winston.
Uh...
I just have to step over the...
I'm not sure how I'm gonna get over the... Here.
Just...
Uh, just... here, come on.
(grunts triumphantly)
Tell her I got over. Tell her I'm okay.
Nick says he's fine.
Hey, uh, Jess?
If one were to put a hammer through a wall, what would one do?
I actually have to get going.
Hello? Je...
Uh, I got to go. Bye.
It was really nice to meet you.
Oh, nice meeting you, too.
Um, I'm Jess.
And you are?
It's on the cup.
Oh. (laughs)
"Daniel." (chuckles)
And your phone number. That's a cool move.
Yeah, it was a cool move, huh?

Schmidt: Hey, Nick.
Did you leave your cereal out?
You need to clean up after yourself.
Shared living space, bro.
I can't do it.
Schmidt, I can't do it.
You can clean up the cereal. Just go put it away.
There's no cereal here; it's in the kitchen. Go clean it up.
Open your eyes, open your eyes to what's happening.
You already sleep in a mud dungeon. Please...

Cece, you're a hot slob.

I'm sorry, what?
Look around, her stuff is everywhere.
It's disgusting.

Love that hat.
Cleaning's fly.
Cleaning's cool, dude.
Hey, everybody, I'm Cece Parekh.
I got a bunch of hats, but I never wear them, 'cause I'm so busy throwing them around, being fly.
Clean up after...!
Let's get her, Winston.
Am I right?
Uh, you know...
I think we should just remember that we all make... mistakes, um...
Don't get soft on me right now.
So keep-keep that in mind as we go forward with our day.
I'm hard to live with?
Nick: Yeah.
Because I got news for you... you are so much harder to live with.
Hey, uh, guys, I-I feel like we're headed down a really unproductive path.
I made tabbouleh. Who wants some?
Yes. Love some.
You tell the same story over and over.
"I've got wet pants." We get it.
Bottom of the glass fell clean off.
It was a science miracle.
No, the glass was hot, and the ice made the glass contract, and that is why it broke; not funny the first six times, and not funny now, 'cause, guess what, Nick Miller... not always funny.
No...
Whoa.
He's... so funny. You're so funny.

Schmidt: So why don't we just sit down and... and talk this out like adults?
I would love to, Schmidty, but where will we sit?
Okay.
Oh, perhaps we'll sit on this pile of uneaten carrots.
It's like I'm living with Secretariat, the horse!

On the plus side, I'm being very witty during this fight!

Number 16.
Yes! Sorry.
I never win anything.

Sorry. Uh, uh... oh.
Dr. Foster, is everything okay?
Foster: J.D.?
It ain't.
I decided I was gonna be Marcus the Meerkat, because, you know, you and I have remarkably similar body shapes.
Okay.
Um, what's the problem?
I fell and shattered my hip.
Oh, God! I'm so sorry.
How bad is it?
The, uh, paramedic described my left leg as a skin bag full of hip shards?
A skin... a skin bag full of hip shards.
You're gonna have to take over my duties.
We are talking about the big job: acting principal.
Yes!
I'd love to!
Oh... but my number just got called.
Well, that means the district's gonna be bringing in Becky Cavatappi.
Ugh!
They've been pushing her for my job.
She has fake zoomers.
What kind of message does that send to girls with growing zoomers?
I think she had her butt done, too.
Every time she runs, that thing sounds like an Indian rain stick.
I really want to be principal, so, um...
I'll be there.
Uh, I'll just have to, uh... get out of jury duty.
I'll talk to you soon!
(shrieks in pain)
Sorry. It's a tense situation.
So who should I call next to tell my story?
I'm not cleaning till you get off the phone, Nicole.
How about Patty's Pizza?
Smooth it out, smooth it out.

I know, I'm a terrible person.
Put Nick on the phone.
No can do, J.
He and Cece are in it.

What? I told him not to talk to her.
How bad is it? Is Nick standing really wide-legged?
Is Cece calling him mean girl names?
Don't call me Nicole!
Okay, Nick-hole!
Yeah. That's happening.
Kids, huh?
Yeah.
Is that Jess? Jess.
It's awful.
I don't know what to do. I'm sure Cece has her flaws, but I just can't see them.
And even if I could, what would I do?
How does a man stand up to the sunset?
Cece and Nick are basically the same person.
Both stubborn, hotheaded and brutally honest.
Oh, dear Lord.
I'm marrying Nick.
Duh.
Aw. I kind of love that.
All right, what should we do?
Can't go to Cece's apartment.
Nadia's baby is teething.
Have you ever heard a Russian child scream?
All the time, in my Putin nightmare.
Look, get Cece to sign the loftgreement.
Nick wrote it, so he'll like that.
They'll both play hardball till they get bored, which will be immediately.
That's good.



You've impressed me today.
Oh, wait, wait. Is that Jess?
Hey, hey. Give me the phone.
All right.
Hey, Jess, Nick-hole here...
What?
Stop calling me Nicole! I'm a boy!
Cece: Nick is calling everyone he knows to tell them this dumb story.
Hello, your friend is a pig person.
Guys, stop.
Hey, Chaz, I'm on the other line.
You're not gonna believe what happens to this glass.
It's an incredible story; you're gonna freak out.
Please stop.
I'll talk to you soon.
Jess: Put me on speaker.
Hold on.

I know which button it is.
Now, what I'm about to say might shock you, but I need help getting out of jury duty.
Oh-ho-ho!
Well, well, well...
Look, I have the chance to be acting principal.
You don't know Becky Cavatappi, but she's a murderer.
What?
She-she's not a murderer, but I... I really don't like her.
You can't just be going around throwing "murderer" on people.
Guys, I need to go in right now. What do I do?
Whatever the trial's about, I say I don't believe in it.
Just tell them that your parents are Pakistani militants.
That's what I do; works every time.
Yeah.
Why'd you have an accent when you said "Pakistani"?
Because that's actually how you pronounce it. "Pakazani"?
It's great seeing you guys work together.
You said it stupid.
I don't really want to lie.
It's kind of not really my brand.

This case involves marriage.
I don't believe in marriage.

Well, you know, you gotta keep the freeway open.
Uh, 'cause... sooner or later, you're gonna get tired of the same cars driving down it.
Capiche?
Yes, capiche.
The two things that are ruining this country are marriage and democracy.
How refreshing.
Another person who wants to get out of jury duty.
I thought some people took this seriously, but apparently not.
Trial by jury is a pillar of our democracy, and yes, it is inconvenient.
But sometimes, sacrifice and civic duty are.
You don't deserve the honor of serving your country.
Maybe you should live in South Africa, where they don't have juries.
I know, I know!
They have a judge and two assessors.
Look, I'm-I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean all that other stuff.
I'd be a great juror.
If you put me on this jury, you will not regret it.

Not relevant? I almost died.

Yeah?

Okay.
First clause: "If a roommate has five or more grooming products in the bathroom, they must use a shower caddy or pay an additional ten dollars in rent, adjusted every two years for inflation."
I currently pay an additional $11.97 in rent.
Okay, yeah, well, I'm not using a shower caddy, because I'm an adult woman and I don't live in a dorm.
