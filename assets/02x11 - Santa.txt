I was five years old when "Santa" gave me my own fire truck and a teddy bear that smelled like my dad's cigarettes.
That's not Santa.
I just believe things and go on believing them.
If someone tells me a fat man's bringing me dolls every year, I just don't question it.
You would've been my nightmare.
We were on very strict instructions from Rabbi Schmulie not to say a word until the last Christian kid found out about Santa Claus.
Ruining Christmas, very bad for our brand.
Well, whether or not Santa's real, it's just nice to have something to believe in.
Did you just say
"Whether or not Santa's real"?
You don't believe in Santa Claus, do you? - No.
Do I wish Santa was real?
I mean, yeah.
Santa's not real, Winston.
Shut up, stupid! You're a dummy!
So... and... I don't even c...
Like, you're the... Okay, aw, here we go.
You know what, look who's talking. You're the same guy who only eats mayonnaise on game days.
That's how you makee the Chicago Bears win.
Hey, Winnie, were you a good boy this year?
Oh, really?
Stop, guys, stop!
Don't throw the cranberries!
Get him!
Stop!
I don't mess around!
No!
Truce! Truce! Truce!
Go for the eyes!
Truce! Truce!
One got stuck in my ear.
We got a cranberry in his ear.
How is that even possible?
Why don't you ask Santa Claus to take the cranberry out of your ear?
Huh?!
I said it got stuck in my ear!
Truce! Truce! Truce! Truce!
♪ Who's that girl?
♪ Who's that girl? ♪
♪ It's Jess.
These pieces don't make a full berry.
There's definitely something still stuck in there.
Hey, would anybody mind giving me a ride to the airport tomorrow?
Full disclosure:
It's out of San Diego at 3:00 a.m.
So tonight's our last chance for a holiday hang-together?
A group hang on the Saturday before Christmas?
No, sorry, I can't tonight, Jess. Office party.
There are literally millions of parties. It's a puzzle as...
That's what you guys are talking about, right?
I mean, it's not like I can hear anything, because I got a cranberry stuck in my ear!
You're yelling.
Huh?
Slade and Sienna are having a house thing.
Oshiro-San is serving whale meat after midnight.
Huh? What y'all talking about?
Shut up.
Sadie is having a cookie-decorating party.
The gorilla twins are having a thump-thump.
Let's try to hit all the parties we can.
Otherwise, I'm just gonna stay home and try not to call Sam.
What'd you say?
I'm gonna die alone.
And merry Christmas.
We have to hang out together.
I hate that idea.
I'll be designated driver.
I'm in.
Okay, yeah, let's do it.
The only we make this work is if we do the Irish good-bye.
We leave the parties without saying good-bye.
And I'm asking you guys as my friends to not be so damn awkward around my stripper girlfriend, just 'cause she's a stripper.
You are the most awkward.
You should probably stop calling her your "stripper girlfriend."
She's unpredictable and exciting, and I love that!
Ol' Nick Miller lives on the edge now. Vroom! Vroom!
And plus, we haven't had s*x yet, and we might tonight.
I understood that!
Oh, yeah!
What'd you say, though?
♪ On the first day of Christmas ♪
♪ My true love gave to me a partridge... ♪
Merry Christmas!
Am I talking too loud?
Schmidt?
What?
A word?
What?
You haven't said one word to Cece since she got in the car.
I cannot believe that you invited her.
She's my best friend.
Hey, can I talk to you a little later?
Oh, were you hoping that I still had some soul left for you to crush?
I'm glad we're gonna be mature about this.
Whoa, what happened there?
Nothing. He told her that he loved her...
Okay, I just want to spend the night making it with some fatty in an elf costume.
Is that too much to ask for?
Instead I'm stuck here at this Lesbian cookie party.
It's all wreaths, no trees.
All right, Jess, you're on the clock;
You have five minutes in this party black hole.
Your friends are cool.
Yeah, no, no, I like them.
Yeah, they...
I live with them.
But being serious, it's been really fun.
I'm glad we're hanging out and spending time together and all that good stuff.
You know, to be completely honest, when I first met you, I didn't think that you could handle this.
Handle what? The fact that you're a stripper?
Me being... Yeah.
Are you kidding?
Me?
Yeah.
Is it good? You're sweating a little bit.
You know what, lady, I was born on the wrong side of the tracks.
I've had tetanus thrice in my life.
Ew. - And look at what a badass cookie I made.
That's the kind of cookie Nick Miller makes.
Fine, look at my cookie.
What?
Yeah, but there are people here.
Are you not into having s*x around people?
Who are you talking to?
Yeah? - I'm so open with s*x, it's ridiculous.
You could at least take your coat off.
Oh, but I can't.
Pastel walls give me the chills.
Hey.
Hey.
Oh, my God!
What?
What...
It's Sam! It's Sam! Put your coats on.
We're leaving.
Sam Sam? Where?
Yes, he's right over there.
He's talking to a woman whose sexuality I won't jump to conclusions about.
What a situation, huh, Jess?
Forced to spend time with someone who ruthlessly rejected you after you told him how much you cared about him.
Maybe...
Damn, he looks good.
Just wants everyone to get along.
Okay, if he wanted everybody to get along...
I'm seriously freaking out right now.
...then he wouldn't have acted like such a callous lady jerk.
Lady jerk?
Lady jerk.
I'm seriously freaking out right now.
Duck! He's gonna see you.
Ow. We have to get out of here, you guys. Where is everybody?
Yeah, man, see, when a cranberry gets lodged in the ear, it hurts. Look.
Psst, Winston.
Hey!
Do you guys know Sam's here?
Jess? - We're Irish good-bye-ing. Go! Go!
Go?
Go, go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go!
All right, Schmidt, what's the address?
Get ready, last year
this party had acrobats
and caged snow leopards.
What?!
We're all here together. No drama.
Not bad, Schmidt.
Thank you.
Are they just gonna play computer music all night?
What are you talking about? That's a really respected deejay, who was also an actor on Boy Meets World.
Hey, Jess. Whoa, Sam.
What?!
No!
Why is this happening? No.
Please, I need to talk... Oh, God.
No. Oh, my...
Oh, I feel like a bird.
Aw, that's just sad.
How are you here?
Winston told me where the party was in exchange for an ear exam.
Winston told you what?!
What?
Jess, listen to me.
I want you back, Jess.
Oh.
Oh!
Are none of these doors?
Oh!
What, he just wants a relationship now, out of the blue?
You never just dreamed about him crawling back to you?
Anybody who's ever been dumped has dreamed about that special someone crawling their way back to them.
I mean, come on, right? It's the dump fantasy.
Let's workshop that term.
Of course I have.
We meet in a hospital, during wartime.
You can forgive a lot during wartime.
That is a fantasy, Jess.
Okay, people don't change.
They just think that they do.
He's a player. Think about it.
Why would a good-looking person ever become a doctor?
Jess?
Oh, my God! Go, go, go, go, go, go!
Go, go, go.
Door...
Jess?
Jess, uh, I don't know if you're in here.
I just wanted to tell you that...
I messed up.
You know, I-I went to that party to see you.
I knew you were gonna be there, 'cause I saw the comments on the Evite.
"Amazeballs, can't wait."
If you are here, I'm sorry if this sounds a little rehearsed.
This is the third room I've done this in.
Hey, what's he saying?
I want to hear...
Shut up, Winston.
Jess?
Jess?
Yep.
No.
You just think you can come back and I'm just gonna be waiting for you?
No, of course not. I mean...
I had to at least try.
You're too late.
I'm in love.
What?
With Winston.
What?
We've lain together.
No, yeah, I don't know how it happened.
It just got stuck up there so far, so quickly.
The relationship.
You know, sometimes when we're hanging out, it can get a little rough.
Oh, boy, does it.
Yeah.
All right. Well, I didn't know that, so...
What's going on? I feel like I'm missing something.
Snow time.
Hey, what are you doing? No, no, no.
Hey, everything is so expensive here, Angie.
Don't. Get off that thing.
Why don't you get on?
You know what?
Get in the sleigh, girl.
What happens in the sleigh?
What happens in the sleigh is I'll be your reindeer...
Uh-huh.
And take your toys up in the sky.
Sexy.
Ooh! Ho ho ho!
Here comes the chubby Santa boy!
Get in here.
This is real.
We are... This is...
You are quick to the belt.
Let's do this.
You have been Taken.
What's that?
A nearly perfect Liam Neeson.
Whoa!
Oh, no!
No! This isn't...
This is my nightmare!
Merry Christmas!
Oh.
Hey. I know... I know you're trying to avoid me, but just take this gift I got you and I will walk away.
I don't celebrate Christmas, okay? Or as I like to call it, White Anglo-Saxon Winter Privilege Night.
I really want us to be friends.
Whenever you're ready.
Because I really do care about you.
Thank you so much for this.
'Cause this makes it so much better.
Here. This is for you.
What if you came home with me tonight?
You look like a hot elf.
Hold still.
Uh-huh.
Got it.
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, man.
Now that I think about it, I mean, I'm not really surprised by you and... you know.
I mean, three guy roommates.
If I really am being honest with you, you were the only one that I was really threatened by.
I mean, you got Metrosexual Jones and Sweatshirt Guy over there.
What are we talking about here?
Yeah, I would trade places with you in a heartbeat.
You know, except for the mustache.
Can I ask you something? How did you get her?
Oh...
Hmm.
Jess.
Yes. Yes, my love.
Honey, we both know we have been unhappy for far too long.
I am not just a vehicle you get to ride to Pleasure Town.
Be gone, honky!
This is for your own good.
Say good-bye to paradise, honey!
We were never going out.
Yeah, I got that.
I mean, Sam, what am I supposed to think?
So what? I'm just supposed to believe you when all of a sudden you come back to me, and you tell me you want to make it work?
I-I want to believe you, but I just feel so...
No!
No! Why do you think you can just kiss me?
I thought that was the right...
That's all this ever was to you.
That's not true, Jess.
No.
No. I'm always so gullible, and I'm not doing it.
I'm not doing it anymore.
I'm done.
Oh, I mean, I get it.
I'm... I'm too late. I messed up.
Yeah, you did. You messed up.
Well, I'll leave you alone. Merry Christmas.
No!
I'm leaving you alone.



I know... I know you do this kind of thing all the time, but believe it or not, I don't.
What? What does that mean?
Look, I know for you, this kind of stuff is normal.
Oh.
Doing it in sleds.
And...
Oh, this is because I'm a stripper.
Yeah.
Are you laughing at me?
No.
I'm laughing into me.
Maybe you just can't handle this.
No. It's great.
You're a stripper for now. I'm a bartender for now.
For now?
We're not gonna be that for...
Okay, well, for now, I'm just gonna walk away.
For now, you can kiss my ass.

Tungsten carbide, because you said that was the most baller metal.

She's so out there and adventurous, and not afraid, and...
She's probably bored of me already.
I mean, she doesn't want to be here.
Does Angie ever do anything she doesn't want to do?
No.

Don't.
Go get her.

Right on. Cool.

Santa.
Black Santa.

Santa Claus isn't even real.
We got a black president, we got a black Santa Claus.
It was not Black Santa Claus!
